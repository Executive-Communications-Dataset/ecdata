`ecdata` is a minimal package for downloading *Executive Communications Dataset*. It includes subsets of all the country data, the full dataset, data dictionaries, and a sample script to help users expand the dataset. For our full replication archive, see the relevant subdirectories in [our GitHub](https://github.com/joshuafayallen/executivestatements/tree/main/raw-data). Stay tuned for a `python` implementation. 

## Installation 

To install `ecdata` run.

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| results: hide 
#| eval: false

pak::pkg_install('joshuafayallen/executivestatements')

```

## Usage 

To see a list of countries in our dataset and the associated file name in the GitHub release, you can run: 

```{r}

library(ecdata)

ecd_country_dictionary |>
    head()

```

To load a specific country's or countries' data, you can use the `load_ecd` function like this. 

```{r}
#| eval: false
load_ecd(country = 'United States of America') |>
    head()

load_ecd(country = c('United States of America', 'Turkey', 'Republic of South Korea')) |>
    tail()

```
