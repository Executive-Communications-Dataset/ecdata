`ecdata` is a minimal package for downloading *Executive Communications Dataset*. It includes subsets of all the country data, the full dataset, data dictionaries, and a sample script to help users expand the dataset. For our full replication archive, see the relevant subdirectories in [our GitHub](https://github.com/joshuafayallen/executivestatements/tree/main/raw-data). For a Python implementation see [execcommunications-py](https://github.com/joshuafayallen/executivecommunications-py).

## Installation 

To install `ecdata` run.

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| results: hide 
#| eval: false

pak::pkg_install('joshuafayallen/ecdata')

```

## Usage 

To see a list of countries in our dataset and the associated file name in the GitHub release, you can run: 

```{r}

library(ecdata)

ecd_country_dictionary |>
    head()

```

To load a specific country's or countries' data, you can use the `load_ecd` function like this. 

```{r}

load_ecd(country = 'United States of America') |>
    head(n = 2)

load_ecd(country = c('United States of America', 'Turkey', 'Republic of South Korea')) |>
    tail(n = 2)

```


We also provide a set of an example scrappers in part to quickly summarize our replication files and for other researchers to either collect more recent data or expand the cases in our dataset. To call these scrappers simply run:

```{r}
#| eval: false

# static website scrapper
example_scrapper(scrapper_type = 'static')

# dynamic website scrapper 

example_scrapper(scrapper_type = 'dynamic')

```
