`ecdata` is a minimal package for downloading *Executive Communications Dataset*. It includes subsets of all the country data, the full dataset, data dictionaries, and a sample script to help users expand the dataset. For our full replication archive, see the relevant subdirectories in [our GitHub](https://github.com/joshuafayallen/executivestatements/tree/main/raw-data). For a Python implementation see [execcommunications-py](https://github.com/joshuafayallen/executivecommunications-py).

## Installation 

To install `ecdata` run.

:::panel-tabset

## R

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| results: hide 
#| eval: false

## Usage 

To see a list of countries in our dataset and the associated file name in the GitHub release, you can run: 

:::panel-tabset

## R 

```{r}

library(ecdata)

ecd_country_dictionary |>
    head()

```

## Python

```{python}
import ecdata as ec
import polars as pl 

ec.ecd_country_dictionary().head(int = 2)


```

## Loading the Executive Communications Dataset

We offer variety of options to load the ECD. You can specify single countries 


:::panel-tabset

## R

```{r}

load_ecd(country = 'United States of America') |>
    head(n = 2)


```

## Python

```{python}

ec.load_ecd(country = 'United States of America').head(int = 2)

```

:::


We also provide a set of an example scrappers in part to quickly summarize our replication files and for other researchers to either collect more recent data or expand the cases in our dataset. To call these scrappers simply run:

```{r}
#| eval: false

# static website scrapper
example_scrapper(scrapper_type = 'static')

# dynamic website scrapper 

example_scrapper(scrapper_type = 'dynamic')

```
