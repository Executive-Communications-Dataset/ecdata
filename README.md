`ecdata` is a minimal package for downloading *Executive Communications
Dataset*. It includes subsets of all the country data, the full dataset,
data dictionaries, and a sample script to help users expand the dataset.
For a full replication archives see the relevant subdirectories in [our
github](https://github.com/joshuafayallen/executivestatements/tree/main/raw-data).
Stay tuned for a `python` implementation.

## Installation
